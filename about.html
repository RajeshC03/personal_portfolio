        <p class="para1">Hello! I'm Rajesh, a passionate software developer based in Bengaluru, Karnataka. With a strong foundation in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I have worked for over a year in the embedded domain as a System Engineer in <a href="https://www.phytec.in/" target="_blank" class="company">SBCS India Pvt. Ltd. Bengaluru.</a> Driven by a deep interest in software development, I transitioned into software development, where I now focus on building efficient and user-friendly applications.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My journey in tech began during my college years at <a href="https://sode-edu.in/" class="college" target="_blank">Shri Madhwa Vadiraja Institute of Technology and Management,</a> where I honed my problem-solving skills and developed a keen interest in coding. Since then, I've been dedicated to expanding my knowledge and expertise in various programming languages and frameworks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with fellow developers. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and work on projects that make a positive impact.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!</p>
